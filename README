Redmine file uploader

SUMMARY
While the REST API of Redmine 1.3.x and earlier don't provide a way to upload
files in the 'Files' section of a project, I created this script. It can be
useful in automatic upload of builds as part of implementing continuous
integration.
This script should become obsolete once this feature is included in the REST
API of Redmine. Please refer to http://www.redmine.org/issues/7725 for the
feature request in the Redmine tracker. 

COMPATIBILITY
Tested using ...:
 - Python v2.6, v2.7
 - mechanize for Python v0.1.11 - http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/
 - Redmine v1.3.0, v1.3.1

HELP
Usage of the tool is explained by invoking it with --help, i.e.:
  ./upload_file_to_redmine.py --help

EXAMPLES
$ ./upload_file_to_redmine.py -f myfile.bin -d "some description" \
   -l "https://redmine.example.net/" -p prjid -u someuser \
   -w some_password

TODO
 - Ability to use a config file and overriding using command line arguments.
 - Provide password on the stdin instead as an argument as this is a security
   flaw - everyone on the system can read the process table.
